# AmazonReviewsAnalysis 📊🛒

**AmazonReviewsAnalysis** is a project focused on analyzing **Amazon product reviews** by integrating relational and non-relational databases. The project leverages **MySQL** for structured data, **MongoDB** for semi-structured data, and **Neo4J** for graph-based analysis, enabling visualization and extraction of insights from user and product relationships.

This project was developed for the **Databases** course (second year of the Mathematical Engineering and AI degree) at **Universidad Pontificia Comillas, ICAI**.

## 📌 Project Overview

AmazonReviewsAnalysis allows users to:
- **Analyze reviews and ratings** from Amazon users for various product categories.
- **Design relational and non-relational database schemas** for storing and processing reviews and reviewer data.
- **Visualize user-product relationships** using **Neo4J** to detect patterns and similarities.
- **Generate insights** such as most popular products, user similarities, and reviews over time.
- **Integrate Machine Learning** to predict product ratings using a Random Forest model.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iqueipopg/AmazonReviewsAnalysis.git
```

### 2️⃣ Unzip the Data Folder
Since the dataset is large, it is stored as `data.zip`. Before running the program, unzip it:
```sh
unzip datos.zip -d data
```
This will extract the necessary .json files inside the `datos/` folder.

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```sh
python src/menu_visualizacion.py
```
You can interact with the program via the command line.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🗃️ Database Design & Integration
- **MySQL** stores structured, relational data (e.g., review details, ratings, and reviewer info).
- **MongoDB** is used for semi-structured data (e.g., lengthy text data in reviews).
- **Neo4J** is employed for **graph-based analysis**, where nodes represent users and products, and edges represent relationships (similarities or common products rated).
### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Similarity Analysis
- The program calculates **Jaccard similarity** between users based on their common reviews.
- **Neo4J** visualizes these relationships, showing connections between users with similar tastes or behaviors.
### 📊 Product Popularity & Insights
- Extracts the **most popular products** with fewer than 40 reviews, displaying user interactions.
- Also, visualizes the **evolution of reviews** over time, with an option to filter by product category.
### 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- **Random Forest** is used to predict **product ratings** based on reviewer attributes and review content.
- The dataset is processed to normalize features and prepare them for training the model.
